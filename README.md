## Description of the app
Website is designed for users who want to create their personal lists of music albums, movies/tv, books and games. Users can rate each item on a scale from 1 to 10 and follow other users to see their lists, plus compare shared items.

The homepage includes activity feed which shows what followed users have added and rated. The lists of other users (and own lists) can be filtered by date, alphabetical order, rating, or they can be searched by title.

Each item has a unique detail page displaying more information of it, for example release year, description, track list etc. Users can also select a "Pick of the Week", which is selected for the current week and displayed in the user's homepage. Pick of the Week resets every Monday.

The search field for items are using third-party APIs:
- Discogs for music
- TMDB for movies and TV shows
- Open Library and ISBNDB for books
- IDGB for games

The search field supports also advanced filtering depending on the source database.

Lastly users can create Rating Clubs, which are private groups for friends to rate the same item. It includes a comment section where friends can leave predefined comments, which are written in a little tongue-in-cheek.
